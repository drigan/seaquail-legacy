    "Description": "Decide on what to do about support for transactions. The issue is that MySQL does not support transactions. To not support transactions at all would be awful. Should transaction related calls in a MySQL adapter be ignored or should they throw an error?\nÂ \nAlso, how should transactions be represented?",
